I decided to pad the files in order to enable fixed_length input for the model.
However, I realised that this might cause the model to be able to predict the class based on how
long the padding is or how stretched the audio is, considering these are the results after writing some code:

Average length for bird: 296.25888324873097
Average length for cat: 287.9635416666667
Average length for chicken: 131.17241379310346
Average length for cow: 89.21311475409836
Average length for dog: 177.1627906976744
Average length for donkey: 68.65
Average length for frog: 89.125
Average length for lion: 150.95238095238096
Average length for monkey: 240.0
Average length for sheep: 96.43589743589743

I will try to just pad it and see what happens. However, I should be wary if i see high accuracy. In order to test whether
this causes unreasonable accuracy, I should hand-pick some samples from each class that have the same original length
and test the accuracy on this.
